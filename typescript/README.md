# TYPESCRIPT MINIPROJECTS

## REQUIREMENTS
For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, Yarn, installed in your environement.

### Node
Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).
You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.
      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm
If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.
    $ node --version
    v8.11.3
    
    $ npm --version
    6.1.0
If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.
    $ npm install npm -g
